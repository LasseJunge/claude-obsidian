# Questions Auto Translate

Open questions and findings about the AutoTranslate feature tracking dashboard.

> [!info] 2026-06-15 meeting
> From [[meeting-2026-06-15-with-Chris]]: "Maybe Karsten sends raw data to **Enzio**."

> [!success] 2026-06-23 — Marion's reply (the data answer)
> Marion (cc Ezio Ferrari, Karsten Peskova) explained how AutoTranslate usage is tracked. **Bottom line: there is no automated raw-data feed.** The Wilfried overview was assembled by hand; automatic updates/overviews would have to be prioritized by R&D.
>
> **How tracking works today:**
> - One **DeepL account** runs all providers (+ Beyond). Each provider has its **own key**, tracked for characters consumed per provider in the current month (billing cycle runs **4th → 4th** of each month).
> - On the ePages side, **each shop's DB stores how many characters it currently uses**. When that exceeds the amount configured in its **ShopType**, the merchant is prompted to **book the AddOn**.
> - When a merchant books it, ePages gets a mail **via Ezio** and the AddOn is added to the shop **manually**.
> - From the DeepL account, CSVs can be **exported per time period** and assembled manually — e.g. `20260604_key_level_report.xlsx`. The Wilfried overview was `20260526_Usage_AutoTranslation.xlsx`, "händisch" (by hand).
> - **No automatic updates/overviews exist.** Would need R&D prioritization → ticket **UNITY-9917** (reopen or open a new case with our requirements).

## Feature Overview

AutoTranslate is an ePages feature that uses DeepL to translate shop content. Usage is tracked weekly via CSV imports with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Store` | Internal store type (e.g. `epagesDE`, `StoreES3`, `Store10`) — NOT the partner |
| `Alias` | Unique shop identifier — used as the primary key per shop |
| `Domain` | Shop domain |
| `TranslatedLanguageCount` | Number of languages actively translated |
| `ShopCharacters` | Total shop content characters |
| `TranslatedCharacters` | Characters sent to DeepL for translation |
| `CostsDeepl` | DeepL API cost in € (European format: `"1.145,07 €"`) |
| col 8 | `AddOnBought` flag (literal string) if the shop bought extra budget |
| col 9 | Date the AddOn was purchased (e.g. `"Dec 2, 2025"`) |

### CSV Structure — Partner Detection

Partners are NOT a column. They are encoded as **section header rows**:

```
Acens:,,,,,,,,
hostalia,40888861,naturalvegano.com,...
```

A row where `Store` ends with `:` and `Alias` is empty = section header → sets `currentPartner` for all subsequent rows until the next header.

Known partners in the 2026-05-26 export:

| Partner | Store types used |
|---------|-----------------|
| Acens | hostalia |
| Arsys | StoreES, StoreES3, StorePiensa |
| Vilkas | VilkasStoreFI |
| epagesCloud | epagesDE, epagesUK |
| Strato | Store10, Store18–Store32, StoreNL3 |
| 1und1EU | Store13, Store18–Store27 |
| TOnline | Store2, Store6, Store7 |

**Known edge case:** `HostEurope` appears inside the `epagesCloud:` block without its own section header → gets assigned partner `epagesCloud` incorrectly. No fix without a manual mapping table or a corrected CSV.

## Dashboard Implementation

Dashboard page added to `Spreedly_Conversion.html` on 2026-06-10.

**Features built:**
- KPI cards: Total Cost, Translated Chars, Shop Chars, Active Stores, Avg Cost/Store
- Filter bar: partner multi-select + ISO week range
- Line chart: DeepL cost over time (respects partner + week filter)
- Bar chart: **Cost by Partner** — always shows all partners; only respects week filter, NOT partner filter
- Sortable store breakdown table with utilization % and AddOn badge
- Search box on store breakdown table
- Weekly CSV import (admin only, stamped with ISO week)
- Duplicate week detection with overwrite prompt
- Data persisted in Supabase `mappings` table (`id = autotranslate`)
- Admin bar buttons are context-aware: Import AT CSV and Clear AT Data only visible on the AT tab

**Import instructions:** Admin mode → Autotranslate tab → "Import AT CSV" in admin bar.

## Bugs Fixed (2026-06-10 session)

| Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| Partner column showed store type (e.g. `epagesDE`) instead of partner name | `atRenderTable` built aggregation with `partner: r.store` | Changed to `partner: r.partner` |
| AddOn badge never appeared | `addOnBought` / `addOnDate` not copied into `byAlias` aggregation | Added propagation in the forEach loop |
| CostsDeepl always 0 | European format `"3,43 €"` not parsed correctly | `atParseCost()` helper handles period=thousands, comma=decimal |
| Partner filter dropdown showed store types, not partner names | `atGetAllStores()` was collecting `r.store` values | Changed to collect `r.partner` |

## Confluence reference — AutoTranslation page (pasted 2026-06-23)

Authoritative content from the [AutoTranslation](https://epages.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AM/pages/5137367066/AutoTranslation) Confluence page (by Marion Kulig).

### Monetization & character limits

Monetization started with **7.111.0** ([UNITY-9665](https://epages.atlassian.net/browse/UNITY-9665), closed). Shop features:

| Feature | Value / behaviour |
|---------|-------------------|
| `AutoTranslation` | `1` (feature on) |
| `AutoTranslationMaxCharacters` | **25,000,000** — the maximal limit once `AutoTranslationAddOnBought = 1` |
| `AutoTranslationMaxPackageCharacters` | base budget; **differs by ShopType** (NowS/M/L/XL). When the limit is reached the merchant gets a notification in **MBO** to buy via **Stripe**. After purchase, someone sets `AutoTranslationAddOnBought = 1` → the shop then gets the `AutoTranslationMaxCharacters` value (25M). |
| `AutoTranslationAddOnBought` | `1` once the AddOn is purchased |

Character-limit decision made by Donal & Wilfried: [AM-19783](https://epages.atlassian.net/browse/AM-19783).

### ShopType budgets (base `AutoTranslationMaxPackageCharacters`)

**ePages Cloud / Direct**

| ShopType | Additional languages ("Languages" −1) | MaxPackageCharacters |
|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| NowS  | 0 | n/a |
| NowM  | 1 | 1,000,000 |
| NowL  | 3 | 1,000,000 |
| NowXL | 5 | 5,000,000 |

**Everyone else** (other providers)

| ShopType | Additional languages ("Languages" −1) | MaxPackageCharacters |
|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| NowS  | 0 | n/a |
| NowM  | 1 | 500,000 |
| NowL  | 2 | 500,000 |
| NowXL | 3 | 1,000,000 |

| Hostpoint | don't activate — they want extra adaptions? | — |
| 1und1US | (not yet) | — |

### System configuration (for activation)

- `ui >= 3.28.1`; `Cartridges.xml → AutoTranslation`
- Scheduler `[AutomaticTranslation]` runs **every minute**, script `AutoTranslation/Scripts/insertAutoTranslation.pl`
- `$EPAGES/j/config/epagesj.conf`: add `deeplAuthKey` — **keys are separated per provider in AM keepass**
- `epages-ui-deployment.yaml`: `TRANSLATION_API_URL = http://#CurrentStore.InternalEPagesJDomain:#CurrentStore.InternalEPagesJPort/rs/deepl/translate`

### Workflow & DB status (7.108.0+)

Merchant adds a language in MBO (or changes product texts) → a row appears in DB table **`autotranslation`** with status `0`. The scheduler processes status-`0` rows:

```
TRANSLATION_STATUS = { PENDING => 0, COMPLETED => 2 (scheduler deletes these on every run), ERROR => 4 }
```

> A full AI translation can only be done **once per language**. Deleting an AI-translated language means re-adding requires manual translation (or temporarily hide languages). To force a re-translation, empty the shop attribute `AutoTranslationTranslatedLanguagesIDs`.

### Accounting

- **DeepL API Pro**, subscription `3480203`, **4.99 €/month** + **usage: 20 € per 1,000,000 characters**.
- Account credentials in AM keepass. Relevant for billing = characters **sent to DeepL**.
- Rule of thumb: Spotlight demo content (~11,000–28,000 chars) ≈ **0.22 €–0.56 € per initially-added language**.
- Even if the ShopType allows only 1 language, all possible languages can be added and are translated immediately (though not visible).
- Helper (pre-activation estimate, a "minimum guess"): `AutoTranslation/Scripts/countCharsByShopForAutoTranslation.pl`.

### ⭐ Export AutoTranslation usage (the raw-data source)

This is the script that generates the per-store usage CSV — the candidate for automating the dashboard feed:

```bash
. /etc/default/epages6
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d")
cd $EPAGES_PATCHES
$PERL $EPAGES_CARTRIDGES/DE_EPAGES_CONSULTING/Store/Scripts/usageAutoTranslation.pl -allstores > TIMESTAMP_provider.csv
```

## Confluence reference — AutoTranslation and Stripe Billing (pasted 2026-06-23)

From the [AutoTranslation and Stripe Billing](https://epages.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AM/pages/5387452418/) page (by Karsten Peskova). DeepL pricing basis on this page: **1,000,000 characters = 20 €**.

> Context (Donal O'Meara): releasing the updated Automatic Translations *with the payment link* asap; a merchant was contacted for testing to validate the whole workflow before go-live; status to be tracked "in Excel, Confluence, or wherever is easiest."

## Open Questions

- [x] Why is the translated character count sometimes higher than the shop character count?
- [ ] How can we identify from what Partner each Shop is? *(partially answered — section headers in CSV, but HostEurope edge case remains)*
- [x] Is the table that Wilfried sent the exact one that we would get? *(answered 2026-06-23 — no; it was hand-assembled by Marion. No automated export exists; would need R&D via UNITY-9917.)*
- [x] What is the base budget and when do shops have to Add On budget? *(answered 2026-06-23 — per-ShopType `AutoTranslationMaxPackageCharacters` (see tables above); when exceeded the merchant is prompted in MBO to buy via Stripe; AddOn raises the cap to `AutoTranslationMaxCharacters` = 25M.)*
- [ ] What is the expected cost per week across all stores? *(now derivable — 20 €/1M chars sent to DeepL; needs the `usageAutoTranslation.pl` export to compute actuals)*
- [ ] How does cost trend week-over-week?
- [x] Is there a cost ceiling / budget we are tracking against? *(answered 2026-06-23 — per-ShopType package limits, hard cap 25M chars once AddOn bought; pricing 20 €/1M chars.)*
- [ ] Are there stores with languages configured but zero translated characters?

## Notes

- The partner filter affects KPIs, line chart, and store breakdown table — but intentionally NOT the "Cost by Partner" bar chart (so you always see the full partner split for context).
- `HostEurope` is the only partner without a section header in the current CSV export.
